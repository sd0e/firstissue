**First Issue** is a site dedicated to helping new programmers discover Git and open-source contributions through real projects. People can submit links to issues on platforms such as GitHub, whereby new programmers can discover these and work out how to solve them themselves. Not only does this help newcomers, but it also helps other, more experienced, project contributors, as they can focus their time on solving more difficult problems.

The site has started soft launch and is available at [firstissue.sebdoe.com](https://firstissue.sebdoe.com/).
